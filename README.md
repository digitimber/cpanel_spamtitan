# cpanel_spamtitan
a SpamTitan Module written to work with cPanel

be gentle, we're new at this - 
We created this repo to house our SpamTitan v7 module script(s) to integrate with cPanel v82
After we found SpamTitan, not being heavy coders, we struggled to create proper integration when new customers were signing up, changing MX records, or adding email addresses and/or forwarders
We eventually created something that worked rather well, and we wanted to share it with the world in case there were others in the same boat. 
a few disclaimers - 
  we are not coders
  we did not follow proper coding proceedures or documentation (commenting and such)
  this script is available as-is, and we take no responsibility for it being compatible or even working with your installations

that being said, we welcome anyone who wants to help us maintain it, or improve it. If you have feature requests, please let us know and we will attempt to add them.

questions, comments, and concerns can be directed to github(@)digitimber.com

Thank you to everyone who contributes to the world wide knowledge base, without you, a lot of us would be lost!
